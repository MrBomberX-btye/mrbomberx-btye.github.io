## Who Am I

Hola ðŸ‘‹, I am Yousef, A
I'm Yousef, a Pragmatic Software Engineer obsessed with Javascript, highly focused on the performance of web applications. <br/>

{{<img src="/images/me.jpg" alt="my image" width="50%" height="50%" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"/>}}

With +2 experience building resilient products on top of NodeJs and Typescript

I love writing due to the love of knowing and mastering something, I love digging into the internals of anything I am exposed to, so writing helps me have a clear and strong mental model about that thing.

ðŸ“–My writings are mainly about:

1. Explaining Backend & Software Engineering Technical concepts.
2. Best Practices of coding
3. Internals of Architecture, tools, and languages we use on a daily basis
4. Software Engineering career guidance and advice.
